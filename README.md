## Macao SUI
Macao SUI is a Server Driven UI(SDUI or SUI) application written purely with Compose Multiplatform.
<BR/>
Bellow is a video showcasing a project demo. In the demo you can see a **Ktor Server Application** running locally and serving a `.json` file. This json file contains metadata that is used then by a desktop application to render specific set of components. A desktop was selected for the video but it is available in Android, iOS and the Browser too.

The Macao SDK allows you to build any type of Bussiness component and present it in with the navigation model of client choice. Current navigation options are `Drawer`, `BottomNavigation`, `Panel`, `TopBar` and `Stack` but clients can create new navigation components as well as customized the existing ones.
